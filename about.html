 <h2>About The project</h2>
<p>
This website was created as part of blockchain and practical learning.
It focuses on explaining blockchain concepts clearly
and providing hands-on experiments.Blockchain Learning Platform was developed as a student project with the goal of making blockchain technology easy to understand for beginners.

Many students find blockchain complex due to heavy technical terms and lack of practical exposure. This platform aims to solve that problem by providing structured learning content along with interactive demonstrations.

The project focuses on both theory and practice, helping learners understand how blockchain works internally.
