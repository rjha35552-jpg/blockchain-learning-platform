## How the Blockchain Demo Works

1. Users generate a wallet using public-private key cryptography
2. Transactions are created and signed using private keys
3. Digital signatures are verified using public keys
4. Verified transactions are added to blocks
5. Each block is linked to the previous block using hashes
6. Mining simulation validates blocks before adding them to the chain

This demonstrates how blockchain ensures security, transparency, and immutability.
